# Github-JD
A tool to compare job descriptions with my existing projects and filter relevant ones and generate relevant bullet points. It also acts as a personal database for storing projects and bullet points, making resume updates easier. Since entry-level roles often require casting a wide net, this helps keep track of different projects for quick access.
