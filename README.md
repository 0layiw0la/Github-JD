### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtualenv or Conda (recommended)
- Git

#### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0layiw0la/Github-JD.git
   cd Github-JD
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # on Linux/Mac
   venv\\Scripts\\activate   # on Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Get your Gemini API key**
   - Sign in to your Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
   - Click **Create credentials** > **API key**.
   - Copy the generated key.

5. **Create a `.env` file in the project root**
   ```dotenv
   # .env
   SQL_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./projects_points.db    # or your PostgreSQL URL
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

6. **Database Setup**

Since each developer uses their own local database, use Flask-Migrate to initialize and apply migrations in one flow:
```bash
# Remove existing migrations folder (if any)
rm -rf migrations/

# Initialize migration repository
flask db init

# Generate initial migration
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"

# Apply migrations and create the database
flask db upgrade
```

7. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py   # or python app.py depending on your entrypoint
   ```
